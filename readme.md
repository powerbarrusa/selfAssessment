#Self Assessment - Block 1

1. **What areas do you feel you are struggling the most in? (Be specific, technologies, habits, etc.)**

I'm slowly understanding Ajax / Promises / Event Listeners. At the moment the entire process is a bit intimidating, but the more I do it the more comfortable I will be with it, and the less scary it will be to chip away at those checkpoints. Unlike most of what we've done, I feel this process involves a bit more memorization so I at least know the flow. The more I do, the more I memorize.

2. **Develop a plan using S.M.A.R.T. goals to continue progress in the areas you mentioned above.** *S.M.A.R.T. - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely.*

I need to be more consistent with practice at home. I should strive for at least one hour each day. Every day I don't practice or at least look at code, I can tell my skills atrophy a little as Nmuta mentioned weeks back. I think my barrier to success is simply being "scared" to start on the stuff that's tough for me. Also not necessarily having someone to answer questions or guide me in the right direction when I'm away from school. I have a feeling one hour won't be enough as we delve deeper into quarter two..

3. **Look back at Block 1, choose 3 'aha' moments where something clicked and describe them below.**

As mentioned below, one "aha" moment came with the layout checkpoint, aka Bootstrap Mock block. I was terrified to open that at first and chipped away slowly over the course of a few weeks. I realized if I trust in the program/process, do as I'm told, and get in the practice in class and simply do what I'm to do, these things will eventually click. Another moment was when I started doing all the optional stuff the first week. I realized I would never be able to keep up and keep my mind and body healthy if I did every, single, block that was on Learn. I let that idea go pretty quickly. I feel I'll achieve more if my mind gets some extra rest and I focus on the primary, required blocks. The last moment came during the brief period from DOM, Event Listeners, and Galvanize Money. I realized between those three blocks, that most everything we do will eventually tie in with the rest. Trust in the process!

4. **What areas do you feel the most confident in? What is making you happy right now?**

I am feeling the most confident in HTML/CSS/Flexbox/Bootstrap, which is odd because that terrified me the first couple weeks after Flexbox was introduced. I wasn't able to grasp the idea for some reason, and after all the practice, slowly but surely I finished the layout checkpoint about a week ago, and feel the most confident there because I'm able to trial and error really quickly with it. I like seeing results right away. The bright side is after that checkpoint completion I realized I could come back to any project at a later date with more practice and achieve completion, so I'm not stressing too hard when things aren't necessarily done right when they "should" be.

5. **What technologies/industries are you most excited about currently?**

I'm very interested to see where Blockchain goes, not because I have a little loot invested in a few "currencies", but because it's new tech., a buzz word, and doesn't seem to be going anywhere. I think it's here to stay in one way or another, and those that can develop in a language associated with Blockchain will probably have an upper-hand in the industry as it becomes more mainstream.
